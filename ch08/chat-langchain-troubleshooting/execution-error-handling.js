const text = `Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology. Similarly, advances in machine learning have led to significant improvements in natural language processing and computer vision.

AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, understanding human speech (natural language processing), self-driving cars, and competing at a high level in strategic game systems like chess and Go.`;
