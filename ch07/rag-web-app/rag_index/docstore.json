A post \n\naccident inspection revealed impact damage to the leading edge of the right wing, right engine \n\nnacelle, and right propeller spinner.  In addition, the inspection revealed a 3-inch crack in the \n\naft wing spar at the right main landing gear wheel well.\n\nProbable Cause and Findings\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:\n\nThe pilot's momentary loss of control after takeoff, which resulted in an in-flight collision with \n\na tree.  A contributing factor was the presence of the tree.","metadata":{"source":"20080115X00053.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.5","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"ADMS","Creator":"Microsoft Office Word","Producer":"Aspose.Words for .NET 17.5","CreationDate":"D:20190830135800Z","ModDate":"D:20190830135800Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":5},"loc":{"pageNumber":1,"lines":{"from":39,"to":59}},"processed_at":"2024-12-03T15:50:50.041Z"}}],["83",{"pageContent":"Page 2 of 5\nCHI08CA048\n\nFindings\n\nOccurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT\n\nPhase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB\n\nFindings\n\n1.

Factors \n\ncontributing to the accident were the pilot's attempt of the low altitude maneuver, and \n\nunfavorable lighting conditions.\n\nFindings\n\nOccurrence #1: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER\n\nPhase of Operation: MANEUVERING\n\nFindings\n\n1.
